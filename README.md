# Sql-Store Data Anaylsis

## Introduction

Welcome to the SQL Store Data Analysis project! This repository houses the documentation, SQL queries, and code for a comprehensive analysis of a store dataset using MySQL. This project aims to provide valuable insights into store, inluding information on the customer base, products, orders etc.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform data analysis on the store dataset to help organizations gain a better understanding of their customers, orders and inventory to make data-driven decisions.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project consists of store information, including customer details, product details, and more.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL:** MySQL was the core tool used for data storage, querying, and analysis, allowing us to leverage the power of relational databases.
- **SQL Queries:** A series of SQL queries were designed to extract and manipulate data from the HR dataset.

## Example queries
